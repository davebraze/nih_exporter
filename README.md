# Purpose
Download and clean data from [NIH ExPorter Data Catalog](https://exporter.nih.gov/ExPORTER_Catalog.aspx)

Code is currently written for interactive use, but at some point I'd like to turn these into more general functions. 

There are two R packages I know of with similar purposes

1. [nihexporter](https://github.com/jayhesselberth/nihexporter)
1. [fedreporter](https://github.com/muschellij2/fedreporter)

NIH ExPorter is updated weekly and Federal RePorter updated annually. NIH ExPorter also seems to go further back (fiscal year 1985) than Federal RePorter (2004).
